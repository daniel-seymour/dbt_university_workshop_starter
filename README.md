# University Workshop Starter
This repository is a **starting point** for an end-to-end analytics engineering project in dbt as experienced in a dbt Labs University Workshop. This repo uses the legendary [Jaffle Shop](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle-shop) project for its curated sample data, but with a much smaller scope: **only seeds** are included so you can get started easily. Your job in the workshop will be to design and build your own staging layer (guided) and then the intermediate and mart layer (independently) to ultimately answer specified analytics/business question(s).

## What you’re building
By the end of the workshop, you should have:
- A specific, relevant analytics question (or small set) stated up front; perhaps opting for 1 primary, 2–4 supporting questions
- A dbt project that runs end-to-end on **BigQuery**
- At least one **`dim_*`** and/or **`fct_*`** model that clearly answers the stated question(s)
- 2–4 tests (at minimum `not_null` and `unique` on primary keys, plus one business-logic test)
- Descriptions for key models and columns so someone new can easily follow the work
- A short write-up in the README, or elsewhere in the repo, with at least one insight stated and supported by data evidence and at least one realistic next step that follows from the insight(s)

---

## Prerequisites
- BigQuery project + dataset you can write to
- dbt (Fusion + VS Code extension) installed and working
- Git installed and a GitHub account
- A working BigQuery connection configured in `profiles.yml`

If needed, detailed setup instructions can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_9MhrFGBjv0MShmynGwTzi2aHLPFDkD7ZTcCxj-iyag/edit?usp=sharing)

## Quickstart

### 1) Fork this repo
Follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) to create your own fork/version of this repo.

Optionally, [sync your forked repo](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#configuring-git-to-sync-your-fork-with-the-upstream-repository) to the main upstream starter repo so you can pull any changes to it later.

### 2) Clone that repo locally using VS Code
Follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository) to clone your forked repo for local development in VS Code.
```
git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL>
cd <YOUR_REPO_NAME>
```

### 3) Confirm your dbt profile name matches `dbt_project.yml` (important)
This project’s `dbt_project.yml` includes a `profile:` value (for example, `default`). **That value must match the profile name you have configured for BigQuery dev credentials in your `profiles.yml`.**

- If your `dbt_project.yml` says `profile: default`, then your `profiles.yml` must have a top-level profile named `default:`. In this starter repo, the `dbt_project.yml` says `profile: university_workshop`, so make sure you have a top-level profile named `university_workshop` in your `profiles.yml` file.

Typical locations:
- In the hidden `.dbt` folder: `~/.dbt/profiles.yml`
- If you are using a repo-local profile (optional): `./profiles.yml`, make sure it is gitignored, otherwise your credentials will be made public!

If the names do not match, dbt will fail with a “profile not found” style error.

### 4) Seed the curated source data (raw layer)
This starter uses dbt **seeds** as the “raw” tables for the project.

Run: `dbt seed`

---

## Project structure (starter scope)
You have:
- `seeds/`  
  Curated CSVs that dbt loads into your warehouse (commonly into a `raw` schema or dataset).

You do **not** have staging or marts models in this repo. You will create the staging layer in the guided portion of the workshop and the marts layer based on the question(s) you have chosen to answer.

Recommended build-out:
- `models/staging/` for staging models that clean and standardize the seeded raw tables.
- `models/intermediate/` for reshaping, reusable transformations, and business logic
- `models/marts/` for business-facing `dim_*` and `fct_*` models used to answer analytics questions

---

## BigQuery notes (common gotchas)
- Make sure your BigQuery credential (typically the locally saved JSON file) has permission to:
  - create tables/views
  - create and write to datasets
  It is easiest to just give the service account `Owner` permissions
- Be explicit about your target dataset (schema) in `profiles.yml` so you can easily find your outputs.
- If you switch GCP projects or datasets, rerun `dbt debug` to confirm everything is wired correctly.

Useful commands:
```
dbt debug
dbt parse
dbt compile
dbt ls
```

## Workshop requirements checklist (use this to self-review)
- [ ] Defined primary + supporting analytics questions
- [ ] Built at least one `dim_*` and/or `fct_*` model
- [ ] Added schema tests for keys (unique, not_null)
- [ ] Added at least one “business logic” test (accepted values, or custom test)
- [ ] Added descriptions to key models and columns
- [ ] Ran `dbt build` successfully with a clean output
- [ ] README (or a file elsewhere in the repo) includes: At least one insight stated and supported by data evidence (numbers, comparison, trend, segment, etc.) and at least one realistic next step that follows from the insight(s)

---

## Suggested workflow (ADLC)
1. **Plan**
   - Write questions, entities, grain, and expected outputs
   - You can place these in a top-level `plan.md` file in your project
2. **Develop**
   - Add staging, marts (and, optionally, intermediate) models with clear naming and layering
3. **Test**
   - Add tests early, document columns and models whilst you're in the YAML files
4. **Deploy**
   - Ensure everything builds end-to-end locally and push changes to `main`
5. **Operate (optional for workshop)**
   - Schedule your project to run via a job (optionally, schedule it) on dbt Platform
6. **Observe**
   - Check lineage and data quality signals via test results
7. **Discover**
   - Add any additional useful descriptions and documentation to the project, models, and columns.
8. **Analyze**
   - Query your marts (or build an output artifact) and write 1–2 insights plus next steps

## Workshop deliverables
At the end of the workshop you will:
- Have a link to your GitHub repo
- Present what you have done covering the items in the `Workshop requirements checklist` above
- Bonus: You may choose to also produce a dashboard (can be screenshots), SQL queries in BigQuery, or a Python notebook that tells the story.
